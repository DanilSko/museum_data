Probably made in the 17th/18th-century in Georgia, but showing the influence of Ottoman and Persian arts of the period. Recent analysis has revealed the colourless stones are diamonds, the central pink gem is a spinel, and that the majority of the other red stones are rubies (with the exception of two, which are spinels). 
The object was given to the BM by Nino Wardrop (Nino, named after the patron st of Georgia) in 1983. Her father was Sir Oliver Wardrop, who, together with his sister Marjory, was an important scholar of Georgian history and literature. Between 1919-1920 he was the United Kingdom's first Chief Commissioner of Transcaucasia (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan) based in Tblisi. The pendant is said to have been given to him then, as a gift for his daughter, then a toddler.
Dr Beka Kobakhidze has shared his book 'Sir Oliver Wardrop 150' (2015) including edited transcriptions of Wardrop's letters in the Bodleian Library.
On February 3, 1920, Oliver Wardrop wrote to his wife, Margrethe, from Tblisi (2015, pp.281-282): 'At tea-time [today] a surprise party came to call on me. I went down and found four little girls (three in white and one in red) and five ladies. The former were called: Makrine Meliki- shvili, Thamar Gvazava, Leila Kavtharadze, Kethevan Eristhavi - all aged about 6, The latter were Mmes. Maria Kvinitadze, Nino Gvazava, Elene Apkhazi, Ekaterine Lorthkipanidze, Anna Diasamidze. The first named little girl came up to me with a curtsey and made a little speech saying that the women and girls of Georgia wished all happiness to my little daughter Nino [the donor of this object to the BM in 1983] on the occasion of her saint's day and asked me to accept for her the small gift she offered me on their behalf. The gift was a fine Old Persian inlaid jewel case containing gold cross something like the one I sent you lately [see description p. 257]:  but smaller and very much finer and with a gold collar set with rubies and pearls - a very fine ancient heirloom which I shall try to describe. / [Drawing and description follows] / The cross has blue enamel round the edges and is of thick gold. It probably contains some relics. Above the cross is a small golden dove with a large uncut ruby and the cross hangs from the bird's neck; the ruby is about this size: The collar is of 26 pieces: each with an uncut ruby of about this size. In the center of a dark blue enamel flower end between each of these pieces and the next are two pearls: in gold mount. Altogether it is a wonderful piece of work containing over 30 large rubies, 60 pearls, and five diamonds. Such jewels are only in a few old families and are hardly ever to be purchased but Grundy happened to see one something like this which was priced well over £150 (Rs 150 000). / On the back it is enameled and chased. / This one must have been bought from the offerings of many people and probably meant a sacrifice for several of those who subscribed for the rouble is only one hundredth part of its former value and most people are finding life difficult. I need not tell you how deeply I was touched by this magnificent gift to our dear little daughter. The guests had tea with us and the little girls danced and played and enjoyed themselves for over an hour.'
A second letter dated Thurday February 5, 1920, continues: 'Dearest love to my own darling and to the darlings Jamie, Andie and Nino. I hear her cross was formerly the property of the Avalov family and this is curious considering that one of that family by marriage is your kinswoman'. - Kobakhidze notes that the kinswoman meant is 'mother of prominent Georgian scholar and diplomat – Zurab Avalishvili, who, likewise Oliver Wardrop’s wife, was of Norwegian origin'.
A third letter, dated Monday April 19, 1920, notes: 'Cherkezov told me yesterday he had been enquiring about the history of our Nino's cross and necklet and found they were the property of the Georgian Royal family originally and passed by marriage to the Apkhazi family, a Russian connexion of whom finally offered them for sale and the Georgian ladies bought the jewel for Nino. It never belonged to the Avalovs.' - Kobakhidze (pers. comm) writes that 'Cherkezov is [Wardrop's] closest Georgian friend Varlam Cherkezishvili, who lived most of his life in the UK. As it is seen from the letter, most likely, Cherkezishvili was informed by the Georgian ladies. There does not exist a better source than this one on this cross and necklace. Wardrop says that it belonged to the royal family, but he does not specify to which Georgian king or Kingdom. He also says that it was passed to Apkhazi (Abkhazi) family as a result of the marriage (dowry). Abkhazi family (not to be mistaken with the western Georgian region of Abkhazia) is a noble family name from eastern Georgian region of Kakheti. Most likely, one of the daughters of one of the eastern Georgian kings got married with some Abkhazi nobleman and she was given this valuable item as a dowry.'
The object is likley to have been made in either the seventeenth or eighteenth century. Its design refers to a famous cross pendant owned by Queen Tamar (1184-1213), the first woman to rule Georgia in her own right. The twelfth century is considered a ‘Golden Age’ of Georgian history. Tamar's cross is a 12th-century golden pendant reliquary cross containing fragments of the True Cross. It is decorated with four emeralds, five rubies and six pearls, and bears the inscription (in Georgian): True Cross, the power of the cross, by your protection King and Queen Tamar. 
One family in particular, the Dadiani showed especial devotion to this cross and queen, paying for the making of a shrine in the later part of the thirteenth century. Four other cross pendants of the BM type are known to exist, and three have links to the Dadiani. When Russia annexed Georgia in 1800, the Dadiani like all other nobles, were forced into exile. 	A portrait of Darejan Dadiani (second half of the 18th century, i.e., 1750-1800) in Amiranashvili museum of Fine Art (Georgian National Museum) shows Darejan Dadiani wearing just such a cross, probably as a way of emphasising nationality and lineage [information about this portrait and the Dadiani family, provided by Dr Nino Simonischwili]. See also a further portrait showing Princess Mariam Avalishvili, wife of Prince Garsevan Chavchavadze, wearing a cross pendant and chain of this type.
In 1983, when this object was first given to the Museum, very little was known about it. 	At that time, a recent exhibition in Geneva (catalogue: T. Sanikidze & G. Abramishvili, 'Orfèvrerie géorgienne du VIIe au XIXe siècle', Geneva, Musée d'Art et d'Historie, 1979) had publicised two similar pieces, both in the National Museum in Tblisi. 	In 2014 and in 2019, two similar pieces were sold at auction. The 2014 example has a Dadiani provenance. The 2019 example has an Armenian-Persian-Russian provenance through Eleazer Lazarovith Lazareff.
The BM pendant, differs in that it has a different mode of suspension and the birds. All other pendants show two addorsed birds (two birds back to back); the BM pendant has a single bird with wings open. The BM bird recalls depictions of the Holy Spirit, except that the bird is beak down and green rather than white.

The same source also states ""it is rare to have different animals or monsters in 'Master of the Beasts' contests. The official heraldic combat is usually with indentical animals or monsters as on impressions from Persepolis. The bull-monster is similar to the guardian figures in gateways at Persepolis, with the same high polos and the leo-gryphs are also paralleled there.

According to the sources mentioned in the inscription (Josephus, 'Jewish Antiquities', XIV, 119; Lucius Annaeus Florus, 'Epitome of Roman History', I, 46 (the Parthian War)), Marcus Licinius Crassus, Proconsul of Syria and commander of the Roman army, was defeated and killed at the Battle of Carrhae by the Surenas in 53 BC. Although it was reported that his head and right hand were cut off and taken to Orodes in Armenia, these same sources also report that in front of the King, molten gold was poured into Crassus' gaping mouth so that the dead and bloodless flesh of one whose heart had burned with lust for gold was itself burnt with gold.

The suspension loop of the pendant is fastened to the apex of the base-plate. It is a 0.7mm wide gold band with a median engraved line. The two ends of the loop are flattened where they are soldered. 
The base-plate of the pendant is a single sheet in the form of an equilateral triangle, with a wedge-shaped projection at the top to support the decoration. In the middle are three tear-shaped cabochons in gold settings with the edges of the collets bent over to secure the inlays. They are arranged in a triangle with the two garnets side by side beneath the green glass setting.
In the field between the two garnets are three granules in a trefoil pattern. There is a beaded-wire border around each collet, which fills the space between the settings. In each corner of the base is a group of six granules arranged in a triangle. Across the base of the triangle runs a 'false-plait' pattern of two pairs of twisted wires. These are flanked by a beaded wire above and below. The pendant has on two sides a similar beaded-wire border, which also frames two granules at the apex. 
Three loops of circular-section wire with flattened ends are soldered to the back of the base-plate.

Originally the pendant was probably part of an earring. It may have been connected to the hoop by means of a smaller intermediate plaque connected by a hinge to the top of the triangle (see Coche de la Ferté).
There is a very close parallel from Kerch in the Louvre. It is of similar shape and construction and is dated to the 4th century by Coche de la Ferté. [1] A similar pair of earrings from Kerch-Glinishche in the Diergardt Collection, Cologne, is dated to the 4th century by Damm. [2] Two broadly similar earrings were found in Armenia in 1909–10.[3] Both are of gold and triangular with gold pendants attached to the base, but with a single, central, tear-shaped cabochon. A pair of earrings from Olbia (Mikolayiv, Ukraine) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, can be related (in shape and construction) to the Crimean ones. It is considered to be Alanic of the first half of the 5th century by Brown,[4] but is in fact of Near-Eastern origin of the 2nd–3rd century (Damm, pers. comm.). The piece in the Berthier-Delagarde Collection is of a later type of this long-lived form. According to Aibabin this type of earring was worn by the Sarmatians in the second half of the 3rd/first half of the 4th century.[5]

A great number of 19th-century Russian icons portray a similar selection of saints to this one, especially on the less expensive, mass-produced examples. The martyr saints Florus and Laurus, both popular in the East Christian Empire, were brothers who lived in Byzantium in the 2nd century and worked as stone masons. For their Christian faith they were tortured and killed. St Modestus (d. c. 630) was the Patriarch of Jerusalem at the time of the conquest of Syria and Palestine by Chosroes II and was especially venerated for his defence of Christ’s Tomb during the invasion of Jerusalem in May 614. Blaise (d. c. 316), was thought to have been of bishop of Sebaste in Armenia and was martyred during the reign of Licinius (307–24). There are a number of saints, both martyrs and venerable monks, called Nikita in the Eastern calendar. The most popular was a Goth warrior who was martyred in 372 at a time of Arian heresy.

Some of the designs, such as animal and geometric motifs, are typical of Sasanian art found on stucco, metalwork and seals. The frequency of cross motifs reflects tolerance of the substantial local Christian population. Analysis of the distribution and style of various stamps suggests several regional ceramic production centres. 
The stamp was carved from wood and a die-link established with several other sherds excavated at the same site, plus a lid which on that basis is assumed to also derive from Kuyunjik. Layard assigned this sherd to the""Persian"" period, meaning in this case the Sasanian period to which sherds of this type were assigned as early as the 1820s by Claudius Rich.

I found, however, that upon some of them cuneiform characters were engraved, and I soon perceived the name and title of the Khorsabad king, accompanied by the figure of a lion' (Layard 1849: 1, 342). He goes on to say that after one of the workmen discovered a complete vase which was then broken with a pick-axe, he himself took in the pick-axe and, working carefully, found another complete alabaster vase (the present example) and the glass vase of Sargon. The material, although popularly referred to as alabaster, is actually calcite.

Red / Red (2015) narrates the story of and through one colour—red. The red used in the project is a specific pigment traditionally made from an insect known as “Ararat” or “Armenian Cochineal” [Porphyrophora Hamelii], indigenous to the Ararat Plain. In her paintings she paints this loss via a transition from a deep carmine pigment to another red pigment, the brighter one of the Turkish flag, common in Turkey. While the latter endures, the former is doomed to vanish. Red / Red proposes a model of co-existence for inhabitants of this contested geographic region through an ecosystem that fosters the production of this special colour.
Armenian cochineal is an insect that lives in the roots of the Aeluropus littoralis plant that grows on the banks of the Aras River, which marks the natural border between Turkey and Armenia. The carminic acid found in the Armenian cochineal enables the production of a special red that has been known back to the 7th century BC. This red was used in textiles, frescos and manuscripts and produced mostly by Armenians.
Aeluropus littoralis and Armenian cochineal have been categorised as endangered species since the industrialization in 1970s’ USSR Armenia. On the Turkish side, there is no threat to the growing areas of the plant and the insect, but the knowledge of producing the red colour is lacking since 1915.
Armen Sahakyan, PhD, a phytotherapist and senior researcher at the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts in Yerevan is probably the only person who can still extract this red based on the recipes from the 14th century Armenian manuscripts.

The practice of making composite statues was long established in the ancient Middle East, but none of any size survives intact. The tradition was carried on to Greece, where some of the finest divine images were described as chryselephantine (ivory and gold). The figure to which this head belonged may have been the base of a giant column.
Unlike the human-headed winged lions and bulls, the clean-shaven sphinx is not typically Assyrian, though like them it was regarded as having protective magical powers. It was adopted from the west, where it was at home in Syrian art, and constitutes another example of Assyrian willingness to accept foreign ideas.

In his right hand he carries a ceremonial sickle of a kind which gods sometimes use for fighting monsters; the mace in his left hand symbolises the authority vested in him as vice-regent of the supreme god.

This statue of King Ashurnasirpal II was placed in the Temple of Ishtar Sharrat-niphi. It was designed to remind the goddess Ishtar of the king's piety. It is made of magnesite, and stands on a separate reddish dolomite or dolomitic limestone plinth. These unusual stones were probably brought back from a foreign campaign. Kings often boasted of the exotic things they acquired from abroad, not only raw materials and finished goods but also plants and animals. The king's hair and beard are shown worn long in the fashion of the Assyrian court at this time. It has been suggested that the Assyrians used false hair and beards, as the Egyptians sometimes did, but there is no evidence for this.

King of Assyria. Inscription note: Incised.","This important vessel is unique and has no close parallels, either in Assyria or in neighbouring areas. Barag (1985: 61) suggests that because the shape is comparable with an Egyptian vessel in rock crystal, the Sargon vase is possibly of Phoenician origin. In any case it was made using lapidary techniques. The inscription is certainly Assyrian, but could have been added later. The presence of the lion is interesting. It often occurs in association with inscriptions of Sargon, and is probably an official mark indicating that the article derives from or belongs to the palace or treasury of Sargon. The vessel was made by casting a solid block, drilling out the centre and cutting away large portions of the exterior to final polishing. There is thick weathering on the interior of the neck but this stops at the base of the neck but a thin residue of weathering inside implies that a limited amount of moisture entered the vesel when it was lying on its side. One deduction from these observations is that the vessel was full of a semi-solid material with an organic stopper when it was buried. As the stopper decayed and the contents solidified and shrank slightly, water penetrated the neck and a very small amount entered the vessel on its side. The contents were presumably discarded after excavation and either then, or later in the nineteenth century, the thick weathering on the exterior must have been removed manually in order to reveal the colour of the glass.
Compare with N.820 (BM.91534).

'The Assyrian army was seen fording a broad river amidst wooded mountains. The sculptor had endeavored to convey the idea of a valley by reversing the trees and mountains on one side of the stream. Rivulets flowed from the hills to the river, irrigating in their course vineyards and orchards. The king in his chariot was followed by a long retinue of warriors on foot and on horses richly caparisoned, by led horses with even gayer trappings, and by men bearing on their shoulders his second chariot, which had a yoke ornamented with bosses and carvings. He was preceded by his army, the variously accoutred spearmen and the bowmen forming separate regiments or divisions. After crossing the river they attacked the enemy's strongholds, which they captured one by one, putting to death or carrying into captivity their inhabitants. Unfortunately, the bas-reliefs describing the general result of the campaign, and probably the taking of the principal city, had been destroyed. Over one of the castles could be traced a few letters, giving no clue, however, to its name or site. The captives wore a kind of turban wrapped in several folds round the head, and a short tunic confined at the waist by a broad belt. From the nature of the country it may be conjectured that the sculptures represented a campaign in some part of Armenia, and I am inclined to identify the river with the Euphrates, near whose head-waters, as we learn from the bull inscriptions, Sennacherib waged one of his most important wars.
The slabs at the western end of this chamber were actually curved backwards, showing the enormous pressure that must have taken place from the falling in of the upper part of the building, by which not only the alabaster was bent, but driven into the wall of sundried bricks.

The fighting men armed with bows and quivers, were made to bear part of the spoil. In the costumes of the warriors and captives, and in the forms of the waggons and war-carts, these bas-reliefs bore a striking resemblance to the sculptures of the son of Essarhaddon, described in a previous chapter. It may, therefore, be inferred that the conquest of the same nation was celebrated in both, and that on these walls we have recorded the successful wars of Sennacherib in the country of Susiana or Elam'.

'In this series of bas-reliefs the history of an Assyrian conquest was more fully portrayed than in any other yet discovered, from the going out of the monarch to battle, to his triumphal return after a complete victory... The king, accompanied by his chariots and horsemen, and leaving his capital in the Assyrian plains, passed through a mountainous and wooded district. He does not appear to have been delayed by the siege of many towns or castles, but to have carried the war at once into the high country. His troops, cavalry and infantry, are represented in close combat with their enemies, pursuing them over hills and through valleys, beside streams, and in the midst of vineyards. The Assyrian horsemen are armed with the spear and the bow, using both weapons whilst at full speed: their opponents seem to be all archers. The vanquished turn to ask for quarter; or, wounded, fall under the feet of the advancing horses, raising their hands imploringly to ward off the impending deathblow. The triumph follows. The king standing in his chariot, beneath the royal parasol, followed by long lines of dismounted warriors leading richly caparisoned horses, and by foot soldiers variously armed and accoutred, is receiving the captives and spoil taken from the conquered people. First approach the victorious warriors, throwing the heads of slain into heaps before the registering officers. They are followed by others leading, and urging onwards with staves, the prisoners - men chained together, or bound singly in fetters, and women, some on foot, carrying their children on their shoulders, and leading them by the hand, others riding on mules. The procession is finished by asses, mules, and flocks of sheep. As on the bas-reliefs uncovered by Mr Ross, there is unfortunately no inscription by which the name of the conquered people can be determined. ... The mountains, valleys, and streams, the vines and dwarf oaks, probably indicate a region north of Assyria, in Armenia, Media, or Kurdistan, countries we know to have been invaded by the royal builder of the palace. The dress of the men consists of a short tunic; that of the women, of a shirt falling to the ankles, and cut low in front of the neck'. (Layard, 1853, pp. 70-1)
'The remaining slabs were covered from top to bottom with rows of warriors, spearmen, and archers, in their respective costumes, and in military array. Each slab must have contained several hundred minute figures, sculptured with great care and delicacy'.

'On its walls were represented the return of an Assyrian army from war, with their spoil of captives and cattle. The prisoners were distinguished by a cap turned back at the top, not unlike the Phrygian bonnet reversed, short tunics, and a broad belt. The women had long curls falling over their shoulders, and were clothed in fringed robes. The fighting-men of the conquered tribe wore a simple fillet round their short hair; a tunic, falling in front to the knee, and behind, to the calf of the leg; a wavy girdle, and a cross-belt round their breasts, ending in two large tassels. At their backs they carried a quiver topped by a circular ornament. The captives bore small squares, which, from their apparent weight, were probably meant to represent ingots of gold, or some other metal. Their beasts of burden were laden with the same objects. A kneeling camel, receiving its load, was designed with considerable truth and spirit. The legs bent under, the tail raised, the foot of the man on the neck of the animal to keep it from rising, whilst a second adjusts the burden from behind, form a group seen every day in the Desert and in an Eastern town. The camel saddle, too, nearly resembled that still used by the Arabs. The women rode on mules, and in carts drawn by these animals and sometimes by men. Asses and waggons bore caldrons, and sacks, probably containing corn. One bas-relief represented captives resting; two unharnessed mules stood eating their barley in front of the loaded cart; a woman seated on a stone held her child upon her knees, whilst her husband drank water from a cup'.

The besieged defended themselves with arrows and stones, but their strongholds were captured, and a vast amount of spoil and captives fell into the hands of die conquerors.

'Unfortunately the bas-reliefs were equally mutilated, four slabs only retaining any traces of sculpture. One of them represented Assyrian warriors leading captives, who differed in costume from any other conquered people hitherto found on the walls of the palaces. Their head-dress consisted of high feathers, forming a kind of tiara like that of an Indian chief, and they wore a robe confined at the waist, by an ornamented girdle. Some of them carried an object resembling a torch. Amongst the enemies of the Egyptians represented on their monuments is a tribe similarly attired. 
On a second slab, preserved in this chamber was represented a double-walled city with arched gateways, and inclined approaches leading to them from the outer walls. Within were warriors with horses; outside the fortifications was a narrow stream or canal, planted on both sides with trees, and flowing into a broad river, on which were large boats, holding several persons, and a raft or skins, bearing a man fishing, and two others seated before a pot or caldron. Along the banks, and apparently washed by the stream, was a wall with equidistant
towers and battlements. On another part of the same river were men ferrying horses across the river in boats, whilst orhers were swimming over on inflated skins. The water swarmed with fish and crabs. Gardens and orchards, with various kinds of trees, appeared to be watered by canals similar ro rhose which once spread fertility over the plains of Babylonia, and of which the choked-up beds still remain. A man, suspended by a rope, was being lowered into the water. Upon the corner of a slab almost destroyed, was a hanging garden, supported upon columns, whose capirals were not unlike those of the Corinthian order. This representation of ornamental gardens was highly curious. It is much ro be regretted that the bas-reliefs had sustained too much injury to be restored or removed'.

'([Footnote:] The figures are about 4 1/4 feet in height.) Those to the right, in descending, represented a procession of servants carrying fruit, flowers, game, and supplies for a banquet, preceded by mace-bearers. The first servant following the guard bore an object which I should not hesitate to identify with the pineapple, unless there were every reason to believe that the Assyrians were unacquainted with that fruit. The leaves sprouting from the top proved that it was not the cone of a pine tree or fir. After all, the sacred symbol held by the winged figures in the Assyrian sculptures, may be the same fruit, and not, as I have conjectured, that of a coniferous tree.
The attendants who followed carried clusters of ripe dates and flat baskets of osier-work, filled with pomegranates, apples, and bunches of grapes. They raised in one hand small green boughs to drive away the flies. Then came men bearing hares, partridges, and dried locusts fastened on rods. The locust has ever been an article of food in the East, and is still sold in the markets of many towns in Arabia. Being introduced in this bas-relief amongst the choice delicacies of a banquet, it was probably highly prized by the Assyrians.
The locust-bearers were followed by a man with strings of pomegranates; then came, two by two, attendants carrying on their shoulders low tables, such as are still used in the East at feasts, loaded with baskets of cakes and fruits of various kinds. The procession was finished by a long line of servants bearing vases of flowers. These figures were dressed in a short tunic, confined at the waist by a shawl or girdle. They wore no head-gear, their hair falling in curls on their shoulders'.

'The slabs on one side of this gallery had been entirely destroyed, except at the eastern end; and from the few which still remained, every trace of sculpture had been carefully removed by some sharp instrument. Along the opposite wall (that to the right on leaving the great hall) only eight bas-reliefs still stood in their original position, and even of these only the lower part was preserved. Detached fragments of others were found in the rubbish, and from them I ascertained that the whole gallery had been occupied by one continuous series, representing the different processes adopted by the Assyrians in moving and placing various objects used in their buildings, and especially the human-headed bulls, from the first transport of the huge stone in the rough from the quarry, to the raising of these gigantic sculptures in the gateways of the palace-temples. On these fragments were seen the king in his chariot, superintending the operations, and workmen carrying cables, or dragging carts loaded with coils of ropes, and various implements for moving the colossi. Enough, however, did not remain to restore any one series of bas-reliefs, but fortunately, on the slabs still standing, was represented the first process, that of bringing the stone from the quarry, whilst those on the northern walls of the great hall furnished many of the subjects which were here wanting. Amongst the scattered fragments was the figure of a lion-headed man raising a sword which does not appear to have belonged to this gallery, unless it had been used to break the monotony of one long line of elaborate bas-reliefs representing nearly the same subject.

'A small doorway to the right of the portal formed by the winged bulls, led into a further chamber, in which an entrance had been found into a third room, whose walls had been completely uncovered. Its dimensions were 26 feet by 23, and it had but this one outlet, flanked on either side by two colossal figures, whose lower extremities alone remained, the upper part of the slabs having been destroyed [231]: one appeared to have been eagle-headed, with the body of a man, and the other a monster, with human head and the feet of a lion. The bas-reliefs round the chamber represented the siege of a castle standing on an artificial mound, surrounded at its base by houses. The besieged defended themselves on the walls and turrets with bows, spears, and stones. The Assyrian army was composed of spearmen, slingers, and bowmen, some of whom had already gained the housetops. Male and female captives had been taken and heads cut off; the victorious warriors according to custom, and probably to claim a reward, bringing them to the registrars. The led horses and body-guard of the king was still preserved, but that part of the bas-relief containing the monarch himself, probably standing in his chariot, had been destroyed. In the back ground were wooded mountains; vines and other trees formed a distinct band in the middle of the slabs; and a river ran at the foot of the mound. The dress of the male prisoners consisted either of a long robe falling to the ankles, or of a tunic reaching to the knees, over which was thrown a outer garment, apparently made of the skins of animals, and they w greaves laced up in front. The women were clothed in a robe descen to the feet, with an outer fringed garment thrown over the shoulders; a kind of hood or veil covered the back of the head, and fell over the neck. Above the castle was the fragment of an inscription in two lines containing the name of the city, of which unfortunately the first character is wanting. It reads: 'The city of ... alammo I attacked and captured; I carried away its spoil'. No name, however, corresponding with it has yet been found in the royal annals, and we can only infer, from the nature of the country represented, that the place was in a mountainous district to the north of Assyria. It is remarkable that in this chamber, as in others afterwards explored, some of the slabs (those adjoining the entrance) had been purposely defaced, every vestige of sculpture having removed by a sharp instrument'.

Assyrian soldiers are bringing in heads, prisoners, and captive women for the counting of the spoil by two scribes, obviously differing in race as in language, who are recording on tablet and parchment (?) the booty taken.

Both the stylus for the tablet and the pen for the roll are held between the index finger, stretched along the length, and the thumb, the other three fingers closing round. The line up the middle of the tablet cannot be certainly explained; perhaps it represents a stick supporting the back of the tablet. In front of the scribes stands a low couch, on which are represented, in rows, daggers, bows, spears, and metal utensils. It is interesting to note the differences in the severed heads, as opposed to the apparent monotony of the soldiery.

'The sculptures panelling the western wall were for the most part entire. They recorded, as usual, a campaign and a victory, and were probably but a portion of one continuous subject carried round the entire hall. The conquered country appeared to have been traversedby a great river, the representation of which took up a third of the bas-relief.  It was filled with crabs and fish of various kinds, and its banks were wooded with date-bearing palms. On one side of the stream was the king in his chariot surrounded by his bodyguard and followed by his led horses. On the opposite bank the Assyrian army laid siege to a detached fort, forming an outwork to a city surrounded by high battlemented walls, and defended by lofty towers rising one above the other in stages. Five square gateways opened upon a small stream or canal. The city walls seemed deserted by the inhabitants, but the fort was defended by archers. Drawn up before it were warriors variously armed, and cavalry discharging their arrows without dismounting from their horses. A kneeling Assyrian, protecting himself by a broad wicker shield, was forcing the stones from the lower part of the fortifications with an instrument probably of iron.
When the Assyrian warriors had taken and plundered this city, they brought human heads to the registrars, according to their military laws to show the numbers of the slain. The spoil, consisting of furniture arms, and vessels of elegant form, was registered by the scribes, to be divided amongst the victorious troops, whilst the captives were either to be apportioned as slaves, or settled as colonists in some distant part of the dominions of the great king. The women with their children were seen riding in carts drawn by oxen. The dress of the male prisoners consisted of a short tunic encircled at the waist by a broad belt, that of the women of an inner shirt and an outer fringed robe falling to the ankles: the hair of both was confined by a simple band or fillet round the temples'.

In set with Sm.2497 (BM.135109).; Layard's description of the scene depicting the aftermath of the Battle of Til-Tuba:
'On the opposite side of the lion-entrance were also three slabs, but better preserved than those I have just described. They formed part of the same subject, which had evidently been carried round the four walls of the chamber. They represented the triumph of the Assyrian king, and, like the battle scenes, were divided by horizontal lines into several bands or friezes. The monarch stood in his chariot, surrounded by his body-guard. Unfortunately his face, with those of the charioteer and the eunuch bearing the parasol, had been purposely defaced, like that of Sennacherib on his monuments, probably when the united armies of the Medes and Babylonians destroyed the palace. The royal robes were profusely adorned with rosettes and fringes; the attendant eunuch was dressed in a chequered garment resembling a Scotch plaid....
In front of the chariot were two warriors or guards in embroidered robes and greaves. Their long hair was bound by a fillet, whose tasselled ends fell loose behind. They were preceded by two remarkable figures, both eunuchs, and probably intended for portraits of some well-known officers of the royal household. One was old and corpulent: his forehead was high and ample; his nose curved and small, and his chin round and double. The wrinkles of the brow, the shaggy eyebrows, and the bloated cheeks, with the stubble beard peculiar to beings of his class, were very faithfully represented. His short hair was tied with a fillet. His companion was younger, and had not the same marked features. He carried before him a square object resembling a closed box or book, perhaps a clay tablet containing some decree or register, such as were discovered in the ruins. Both wore long plain shirts, and round their waists a simple cord, in which was fixed a whip, probably a sign of their office....
Above the royal chariot was a row of trees, and beneath a procession of mace-bearers and led horses, richly caparisoned. A lower compartment contained a curious ground plan of a city. ... Its position between two rivers well agrees with that of existing ruins generally believed to mark its site. The smaller stream would be the Shapour, and the larger the Eulocus or river of Dizful. The city was surrounded by a wall, with equidistant towers and gateways. The houses were flat roofed, and some had one tower or upper chamber, and others two. They had no windows, and their doors were square.... Outside the walls were groves of palms and other trees, and a kind of suburb of houses scattered amongst the gardens is around Baghdad and Busrah. On the river bank stood two forts with towers, one raised on an artificial mound. Near the large river, at the bottom of the slab, was either a pond in the midst of palm trees, or the source of a rivulet which fell into the main stream.
The adjoining slab was divided into eight bands or friezes, by parallel lines, and the next slab into seven. On both were represented the Assyrian army returning from its victorious campaign, and bringing to the king the captives and the spoil. The prisoners, who were probably considered rather rebels to his authority than enemies, were being cruelly tortured in his presence. The principal group was that of the eunuch general, or Tartan, leading a chief or prince of the conquered people. With one hand he grasped his captive by the wrist, and raised in the other a long and massy spear. At his back was hung a quiver and bow, and an embossed belt encircled his mailed vest. The prisoner wore a simple robe falling to his ankles, and a knotted fillet round his head. Above him was an inscription unfortunately much mutilated. It appears to have declared that he was one of the sons or chiefs of the Susianian monarch, defeated and slain in battle near the district of Madaktu....
Before the captive prince were gathered a number of the Susianians, probably the subjects of the slaughtered king, who had come to surrender the Assyrian general, for they still carried their arms, and were not led by the victorious warriors. Some of them knelt, some bowed to the ground, and others, stretched at full length, rubbed their heads in the dust, all signs of grief and submission still practised in the East. They were followed by a led horse, and by a cart drawn by a mule, resembling those represented in the battle scenes. Another Tartan of the Assyrian army, holding his war-horse and carrying his spear, also received the homage of the conquered Susianians. The Assyrian generals were welcomed by bands of men and women, dancing, singing, and playing on instruments of music....
The musicians were accompanied by six women and nine boys and girls of different ages, singing and clapping their hands to the measure. The first were distinguished by various head-dresses. Some wore their hair in long ringlets, some platted or braided, and others confined in a net. One held her hands to her throat, as the Arab and Persian women still do when they make those shrill and vibrating sounds peculiar to the vocal music of the East. The whole scene, indeed, was curiously illustrative of modern Eastern customs. The musicians portrayed in the bas-relief were probably of that class of public performers who appear in Turkey and Egypt at marriages, and on other occasions of rejoicing.
Behind the two Assyrian generals were cavalry, chariots, led horses, and armed warriors, forming two friezes of considerable beauty, no less remarkable for the delicacy of the execution than for the very spirited and correct delineation of the animals.
A long line of warriors, some bearing maces, bows, spears, and shields, and other crossing their hands before them in the common Eastern attitude of respect, formed a frieze across the centre of the slabs. They were the attendants and body-guard of the king, and were represented of different heights, being probably picked men formed into companies or regiments according to their size and strength. They walked in front of a row of trees.
Above the Assyrian warriors were the captives and their torturers. The former differed in costume from the Susianian fighting-men represented in the adjoining bas-reliefs. They were distinguished by the smallness of their stature, and by a very marked Jewish countenance - a sharp, hooked nose, short bushy beard, and long narrow eyes. Could they have belonged to the Hebrew tribes which were carried away from Samaria and Jerusalem, and placed by Shalmaneser, Sennacherib, or Essarhaddon, as colonists in the distant regions of Elam, and who, having become powerful in their new settlements, had revolted against their Assyrian rulers, and were once again subdued? They wore a kind of conical cap, to which were attached two or more tails or ribands, an inner garment reaching a little below the knee, an outer fringed robe falling down the back to the ankles, and boots turned up at the toes and laced in front. A band hanging over their shoulders ended in a tassel. Some in iron fetters were being led before the king, for judgment or pardon. Others had been condemned to the torture, and were already in the hands of the executioners. Two were stretched naked at full length on the ground, and whilst their limbs were held apart by pegs and cords they were being flayed alive. Beneath them were other unfortunate victims undergoing abominable punishments. The brains of one were apparently being beaten out with an iron mace, whilst an officer held him by the beard. A torturer was wrenching the tongue out of the mouth of a second wretch who had been pinioned to the ground. The bleeding heads of the slain were tied round the necks of the living who seemed reserved for still more barbarous tortures. ...
The only spoil represented in these bas-reliefs as carried away by the Assyrians consisted of horses and bundles of precious woods. At the top of each slab was a frieze of warriors drawn up in array, and at the bottom a broad river filled with those killed in the fight, and horses, mules, chariots, carts, bows, and quivers.

The two armies are clearly distinguished by their equipment. The Assyrian cavalry and some of the infantry have pointed helmets and wear scale-armour above the belt; most of them carry spears and shields, as do other infantrymen in crested helmets, and there are lightly armed archers with headbands. They tend to operate in pairs,  with an archer protected by a spearman. The Elamites are nearly all lightly armed archers, with  headbands  tied  at the back;  their quivers are decorated with palmettes. Some of them are riding carts drawn by donkeys or mules. It is clear that, once the heavily armed Assyrians have forced their way through the Elamite lines, the Elamites cannot operate effectively at close quarters. They stumble back down the side of the mound, and their retreat turns into a rout, which ends as they are driven into the River Ulai. The growing chaos is graphically reflected in the overall arrangement, with the largely horizontal lines of figures losing coherence as they move right, and the river stopping them dead as it cuts across the scene from top to bottom.
Within the battle, critical incidents are picked out, forming an internal sequence of events like a strip-cartoon operating independently of the general progress of the battle. In this scene, the Elamite king Teumman is identified and carried away in a chariot. 
Two other specific incidents are shown, in the central row below Teumman's chariot.  On the right an Elamite noble is cutting his bow in token of surrender, while an Assyrian threatens to kill him, and on the left a wounded Elamite calls to an Assyrian to cut off his head.

In set with 1881,0204.6 (BM.135122).; From clay tablets describing the scene, we learn that the prisoners in the upper register, men, women and children, belong to the Gam-bulu tribe of Babylonia which had broken its oath to Assyria and supported the Elamites. 
The  Battle  of Til-Tuba (or  the   River Ulai),  showing  the Assyrians  defeating the Elamites of southern Iran, is arguably the finest large-scale composition in Assyrian art. Though the beginning of the battle is lost, the rout of the Elamite army on three adjoining panels forms essentially a complete unit on its own. This was one of a  series of about ten compositions, recounting the story of an entire campaign, which lined the walls of a room in Sennacherib's palace but were actually carved for Ashurbanipal. The carvings are described in several clay tablets, which enable us to restore the entire   decorative scheme in principle. Some of the incidents in the battle are also described in captions cut on the sculptures themselves, but the tablets give additional details which help to explain what is happening. The battle scene occupies the lower half of these three panels; the upper half, less well preserved, shows a review of prisoners deported after the campaign. 
The date of Ashurbanipal's war with Teumman is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from 663 to 653 BC. It was the first of a series of wars which culminated in the destruction of the ancient Elamite capital city of Susa. When Nineveh was destroyed in 612 BC, there were men who still recognised the scenes depicted in this composition. 
The panel is carved in a fossiliferous limestone, not the standard gypsum. The stone was brought by Sennacherib down the Tigris from the Judi Dagh, near Cizre in modern Turkey,   where he had observed it on campaign. Several Assyrian kings note with pride their imports of unusual materials such as this.; Layard's description of the scenes of The Battle of the River Ulai, depicted in Room XXXIII (BB):
'The three slabs to the right of the winged lions on entering, were occupied by a highly curious representation of a battle. The subject was incomplete, and could not be restored. The Assyrians, having besieged and captured some great city, appeared to be pursuing the flying enemy. On the first remaining slab was part of a mound, on which a castle was probably built. Down the side of the artificial elevation ran the defeated warriors, no longer attempting defence, but giving themselves up to despair. One was plucking out his beard, a common action amongst easterns [sic] to denote grief; some tearing their hair, and others turning round to ask for quarter from their merciless pursuers. On the sides of the mount were the dead and dying, and the bows and quivers of the slain. A wounded mule was falling to the ground, whilst his rider, pierced by an arrow, raised his hands to implore for mercy. An Assyrian soldier, or ally, distinguished by a low round cap, and a kind of belt or shawl twisted round his breast, was dragging a body towards him, probably with the intention of cutting off the head. Beneath the mound a horseman was piercing with his spear a flying enemy, and two warriors in a car drawn by a mule, were hastening from the battle-field.
The remainder of the subject was divided by horizontal parallel lines into six parts ot friezes; of which, however, only three were entire. From the number of figures introduced, and the complicated nature or the action, it is difficult to describe these important bas-reliefs intelligibly. In the lowest compartment, archers and spearmen, some on horses, were represented in close combat with the enemy, whose armies, like those of the Assyrians, were composed of footmen and cavalry. The battle-field was strewn with the slain, and with their scattered arms; but, as usual, the sculptor, to flatter the vanity of his countrymen, had not portrayed single Assyrian either dead or wounded. In the second frieze the enemy were seen fighting in carts drawn by mules. In the next compartment were Assyrian warriors bearing the heads of the slain, and leaving the field of battle in a cart captured from the foe....
Behind the cart with the Assyrian warriors, was the tent of the registrar to which had been led a captive chief and his two attendants, were collected a heap of human heads, whilst warriors were bringing more of these bloody trophies to the appointed scribes. In another part of the battle was seen the chariot of one of the princes of the Elamites. Four spirited horses, wounded by arrows, were plunging and rearing; and the chief with his charioteer were falling from the overturned chariot. Beneath was a group representing an Assyrian warrior holding his horse by the bridle, and advancing towards a fallen enemy, who, turning towards his conqueror, placed one hand upon his throat, a gesture either of entreaty, or to indicate his approaching fate. Above him was an epigraph, commencing apparently with his name, of which only one letter remained, and declaring that he was a general of the Susianian king(?). Around these groups, Assyrians, armed with battle-axes and maces, were slaying the unresisting foe. In this part of the bas-relief were two short epigraphs, which appeared to state that the slaughtered warriors were sons of the king of Elam. These princes were distinguished by a peculiar round cap, to which was attached a long feather falling down the back, a head-dress subsequently worn by Persian kings. They were clothed in embroidered and fringed robes, and their chariots were drawn by four horses.
Crows and vultures were represented feasting upon the carcases of the slain. Adjoining the field of battle was a broad river, into which the Assyrians were driving the retreating enemy: it was filled with the dead bodies of men and horses, and with bows and quivers.
Above the battle scenes were the conquerors torturing, and leading into captivity, their prisoners. They were divided into three rows, parts of two only had been preserved.
Several of the captives were apparently about to undergo some dreadful torture; with their hands manacled in iron fetters, they knelt over an object which might be a chafing-dish with hot coals or a vessel to receive their blood. One of the torturers held his victim by a collar round his neck; whilst a second, seizing the unfortunate prisoner by his hair, was about to strike him with an iron-headed mace.... The Elamites, we find from these bas-reliefs, used even in war, besides chariots, a kind of cart drawn by mules, and consisting of a flat stage raised upon lofty wheels, which had as many as twelve and even sixteen spokes. The largest of these cars could hold five or six persons, and were adorned with a fringed or embroidered cloth. The smallest it would appear contained only two, the warrior and the charioteer, who sat on a kind of raised seat. ... The harness of the mules consisted of a simple band round the chest, hung with rosettes and tassels, probably of colored wool. They were guided either by reins, or by a long rod held by the charioteer in his right hand. Mules were also, it would seem, ridden by this people in battle, and were then caparisoned like horses. The dress of the fighting men consisted chiefly of a tunic, or single shirt, falling to the knee, and bound at the waist by a narrow girdle. Some of them had round their shoulders a kind of band knotted in front. This appears to have been a contrivance to support the quiver suspended at the back. Their hair was long, and was confined by a fillet, or rib and tied behind the head in a kind of bow. The captive chief and his attendants in the tent wore robes falling to the knee in front, and to the ankles behind. Those who fought on foot were armed with the bow, but die cavalry used the spear. The archers carried at their backs quivers of peculiar form, and ornamented at the sides and on the top with rosettes. I have already described the peculiar dress of the princes; it was completed by high boots or greaves laced up in front, and probably of yellow leather.
Amongst the captives were men clothed in fringed robes and a short under-tunic: these were probably the lords of the land. The women wore their hair in curls, falling on their shoulders, and bound above the temples by a band or fillet. Some had one long ringlet on each side of the face. Their children were either naked or clothed in simple shirts'.

The pair may represent 20 and 30 shekels respectively, though not by the Assyrian standard.
It has been suggested that the winged scarab was the official royal symbol of the kings of Judah (Yadin 1967), though it may also have been used by other states in Palestine or Phoenicia. It seems probable, then, that this weight came to Assyria as part of a consignment of tribute or booty, and was simply left in store about 710 BC when the North-West Palace ceased to be a royal residence.  It was found in a storeroom which included many items which could well have belonged to some such consignment or consignments from the west, since the Assyrians did not necessarily have any use for all the things they collected; the storerooms full of ivory furniture at Fort Shalmaneser are a notable example.","Curtis & Reade 1994a / Tesoros de asiria en el Museo Britanico: Arte e Imperio; Budge 1922a / A guide to the Babylonian and Assyrian antiquities.; Boardman J 1984a / The Cambridge Ancient History, Plate to Volume III; Layard A H 1853a / Discoveries in the ruins of Nineveh and Babylon, with travels in Armenia, Kurdistan and the desert; Curtis & Reade 1995a / Art and empire: treasures from Assyria in the British Museum; British Museum 2011a / Splendours of Mesopotamia",Not on display,"Exhibited:

This was the second of Mathers' re-translations to be published by John Rodker at the Casanova Press, immediately after the 16-volume edition of the Arabian Nights (1923-24). It found favour with at least one reviewer, who wrote the following in the ""Times Literary Supplement"", 12 Feb 1925, p.98:

""TALES FROM KING SOLOMON. By ST. JOHN D. SEYMOUR. (Oxford University Press. London & Milford. 7s. 6d. net.)
THE QUEEN OF SHEBA. Translated into French from his own Arabic Text by DR. J. C. MARDRUS. The English version by E. POWYS MATHERS. (Casanova Society. 5s. net.) 

To many people King Solomon is known, apart from his Scriptural reputation, only as the sympathetic monarch who figures in the story of ""The Butterfly who Stamped,"" as told by Kipling; and to these his multifarious activities enumerated by Dr. Seymour will come as a revelation of hitherto unsuspected facets in his character. They will, however, be rather puzzled as to the chronology of the wise King. Dr. Seymour has collected stories and legends about him from Jewish, Moslem and various Christian sources - Greek, Latin, Anglo-Saxon, Abyssinian, Armenian and Ukrainian; and without touching upon the mystical theory propounded by certain Arabians and some Freemasons in this country that King Solomon Davidson was in reality but the personification of an entire dynasty of preternaturally long-lived pre-Adamite kings of his name, he shows the monarch in turn as a devout Jew, a strict Moslem, the husband of a wife who refuses to cross herself on entering a church, and even as an over-enthusiastic sportsman who goes with his gun to shoot a hare. 

Of the king's power and magnificence there is no doubt; for provided with his magic ring he is, besides being a Prophet and a King, hailed in many of these legends as the Viceregent of God, and exercises power over the Winds, the Jann, the beasts, and particularly the birds. Yet this almost omnipotent Prince is reduced to all manner of tricks and shifts. He has to allay his curiosity as to the reputed hairiness of the Queen of Sheba's legs, or her alleged possession of a foot so malformed as to resemble that of a goat, by a transparent device; he has to entrap Ashmedai, the King of the Jann, by making him drunk; he must overcome the diffident shyness of Queen Balkis by torturing her with thirst in defiance of his duties and courtesies as a host; and is dependent upon the services of the worm Shamir in preparing the stones for the Temple. Then, again, he is frequently humiliated, doubtless as a corrective to character, in order to keep any tendency to overween in check. He is rebuked by the baby sea-monster, by the sparrow, by the virtuous wife in whose pursuit he tries to prove himself a true son of David and Bathsheba, and is put to shame by the repulsive Marcolphus, who apparently exists only for the purpose of making a mock of Solomon. In one curious legend the wise King is made to share the fate of ""Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane,"" while Ashmedai, the King of the Jann, is permitted to reign in his semblance and his stead until he betrays his true nature by an ignorance of the Mosaic Law inconceivable in the case of the real Solomon. There is a quaint touch of Nebuchadnezzar [sic] in the days of his bestial retirement about this legend, as the exiled King takes pleasure only in a dish of herbs offered by a poor man who recognizes him, although a tattered beggar, as the rightful Solomon. 

Many of these stories are conceived in the fine fleur of Oriental imagination, and would be appropriate on the lips of Sheherazade. The canpy of the wings of birds, the carpet which measured sixty miles each way, the description of the appearance of the Jann, the amputation of the gnat's tongue, the story of the aged eagles, are all conceived in that happy vein of exaggeration and fantasy which distinguishes the products of the story-teller in the bazaar. Some might take their place in a collection of folklore, while others, again, are devoid of local colour and abound with evidences of their foreign and non-Semitic origin. 

Yet, apparently, it is a Moslem tradition which ascribes a not wholly human origin to Balkis and makes her a regicide before she came to Solomon. Far preferable to this crude defamation of the ancestress of the Royal House of Ethiopia is the Mathers-Mardrus legend, with its exquisite polish and charming sentiments. In this King Solomon is the first love of the Queen of Sheba; and his affection for her is so great that he becomes strictly monogamous in loyalty to his Sabaean bride. This admirable rendering of the story contains much poetry, not a little magic, and a version, alike more credible and creditable, of how the Hoopoe won his golden crest. In the Mathers-Mardrus story of Balkis Solomon appears as the Master of Men and Jann. He may scold the latter if they fail in their task, or urge them to fresh efforts with threats of his displeasure, but he treats them as a despot might be expected to deal with valued servants. In some of the other legends Solomon is made to treat the Jann with unconscionable and apparently needless harshness. He is to them a terrible and cruel taskmaster; and the Levant seas are described as being so littered with the brazen vessels in which miserable Jann are imprisoned by the power of his seal that these are a perfect nuisance to fishermen. Yet the same Solomon forgave the deliberate desertion from his post of duty by the nightingale, who was on fire to sing to the opening rosebud, on the ground that it was his custom to yield to this annual madness; and he was kind even to such reprobates as the nation of Sabbath-breaking Jews who had, for their sins, been turned into apes. How, then, can the story-teller be justified in making so wise and tolerant a Prince ill-treat the Jann, who could not help having been born blue, leaf-eared, ugly, deformed, and even acephalous?""",,Not on display,"Exhibited:

Nowadays the capes are worn only by high ranking church officials.
Luxurious fabrics such as velvet were imported into Ethiopia during the nineteenth century. The raw material for the silver thread comes from the Maria Theresa silver dollar, a coin minted in Austria. They had been used widely in trade with North Africa since the eighteenth century. Local Armenian silversmiths melted them down to use for the intricate decorative patterns sewn onto the capes.

He needed the money to pay the debts of the Armenian community in Jerusalem, and to remove the threat of Moslem creditors, that they would seize the cathedral of St James and other churches and properties belonging to the Armenians in Jerusalem.

The peahen motif in the centre must have been drawn from a stencil as other dishes, specially one in the Victoria and Albert Museum from the Salting Collection, C2005-9010, also uses it but with a different border. See N. Atasoy and J. Raby, 'Iznik', London and New York 1989, p. 254, fig.532. The original now in the Wallace was a well-known collector's piece and was illustrated when in Count Schwiter's collection in 1866, E.Lièvre, 'Les Collections celebres', Paris 1866, plate 3; the same author illustrated it in the 1880s ['les arts graphique', Paris, undated] as belonging to Richard Wallace.

Pen and black ink, with grey wash",Drawn by: James McBey,,,,,,,1918,,,,,,,paper,,,drawn,Height: 305 millimetres; Width: 241 millimetres,"Inscription type: inscription Inscription quoted: Signed and dated: ""James McBey/16 February/1918""","The British Museum has a collection of 74 drawings made during World War I by James McBey (1919,0412.15-88). In the register of acquisitions, they are titled 'James McBey: drawings as official artist with Egyptian Expeditionary Force 1917-19' and each drawing is listed with its date and title. They were presented to the British Museum by H. M. Government in 1919, but first, a number of them were exhibited at at the Colnaghi & Obach Galleries in London from January to February 1918.
A self-taught Scottish engraver, McBey was appointed Official War Artist to the British Expeditionary Force under General Allenby in Egypt in 1917. He had been stationed in Rouen the previous year and had been struggling to find ways to circumvent the army's sketching prohibition, when he first became aware of and applied for the position of Official War Artist. In 1916, when the public was losing interest in the government's war photography, CFG Masterman, head of the Government Propaganda Department, had begun commissioning artists (such as Muirhead Bone, Paul Nash) for representations of the war. The artists were sent to various locations and given free rein to represent the war surrounding them, their only requirement being to submit their work to the Government Propaganda Department for public exhibitions or publications (although there were some restrictions placed on Bone's work in the Western Front, see 1919,0208.1). McBey owed this new position to the recommendation of Campbell Dodgson, Keeper of the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum who also worked for the Propaganda Department: 'I can think of no artist more suitable for drawing in Egypt than James McBey. ... He has made a considerable reputation as an etcher and also as a watercolour artist. ... He is a very steady, reliable man and I can confidently recommend him. A man who is so good both at black and white and colour, drawing and etching, should find military subjects in Egypt a congenial sphere of work' (see Johnson p.7). McBey, an etcher at heart, first experimented with watercolours in the winter of 1912 during his stay in Morocco. He had previously been using oils as a means of sketching his landscapes but, after arriving in Morocco, he quickly realised that watercolours suited the Moroccan landscape, with its bright sunlight and white houses, much better. Given the artist's 'intuitive understanding of the Eastern atmosphere', according to Salaman (Salaman, p. xviii), Dodgson's recommendation for the position of Official War Artist in Egypt is not surprising. 
McBey sailed for Egypt on May 26, 1917 and remained in the Middle East until February 4, 1919. During these two years he followed the campaign through Egypt, Arabia, Palestine and Syria. He was present for the capture of Jerusalem and got as far as Damascus, where he painted his famous portrait of Lawrence of Arabia (Imperial War Museum). McBey took his position very seriously, waking up at 5 am to record the sights and events he came across (from Armenian refugee camps to desert landscapes) before the heat became too intense. By the end of his commission, he had sent back to the war office over 300 drawings, watercolours and paintings, each of which was accompanied by a lengthy and detailed annotation.

One of their greatest artistic achievements was the  glorious pottery of Iznik,  a centre of ceramic production established in the  1480s that continued for over 200 years. Over time, Iznik potters introduced  different shapes, styles and colours, culminating in the 1550s with a brilliant red  and a range of floral motifs, including the tulip, whose introduction  to Europe led  to ‘Tulipomania.’ 
The Ottoman elite, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, all  commissioned and consumed products such as Iznik ceramics. The Armenian  inscription on the base of this ewer commemorates ‘Abraham, servant of God, of  Kütahya.’ Kütahya was a thriving town under the Ottomans, with many Armenian  Christians residing there.

Title: A Quest for Contemporary Felts in Anatolia.      Last year I was commissioned by the British Museum to travel around Turkey gathering together a group, or representative cross-section, of examples of contemporary felted textiles from the various regions, to extend and develop the Museum's existing collection.      The journey began from Istanbul and ended at the city called Mardin in the south east near the Iranian border.  The eight different regions visited were, it was discovered later, the only ones where felt makers and centres survive, apart from among the mountaineer nomadic groups such as the ‘Yuruk'.  I had gathered names and addresses in advance through recommendations of each to the other, and some obtained at the International Felt-makers' Association symposium.  In August I set off with a friend and colleague with two digital cameras and a borrowed car for a round trip of two thousand and seven hundred miles spread over a two-week period.      Our first destination was Kula, a small town of the Aegean region which had been a very important felt-making centre until the late 1970s.  Now there is only one workshop where they produce decorated, coloured, felted wool rugs or wall hangings.  The remaining makers were producing only plain felt.      The felt-makers' quarter is next to the tanneries, where they take and use fleece, called the scrub of hides.  Felt made of this second quality raw material smells very bad and tends to lose hair very quickly.  Eventually standards/requirements for felted rugs and wall hangings became more rigorous and compared to commercially produced items, local felts fell short of that standard.  Consumers switched to woven carpets and kilims made of better wool.      But one of the family businesses in town decided to carry on felt-making and, using better wool, is still producing some felt for the tourist trade in the bigger holiday resorts.  They use the same traditional motifs in their work, but in different colourways. ... Their felt was hard and tensile qualities were of a low standard.      Our next stop was Tire.  Mostly popular amongst the 'culture tour' tourists, this centre has one of the biggest populations of felt makers. They are local people and all are family businesses in which father and son are involved.  Felt making is in most cases a side activity, secondary to their fig orchards and vineyards. They work usually with chemical dyes, but one or two masters use natural dyes/vegetable dyes.  Wool from local sheep is their base raw material, supplemented by some other qualities from regions inland, principally Konya.       Apart from village commissions, they stock produce for the foreign tourist, as well as for local tourists. The feltmakers' quarter was decorated with bunches of hanging felts on their shop fronts or any free wall space they could find nearby.  Especially unusual shapes like oval and circular pieces are to be found, also arched-shaped prayer mats ...      One of the workshops had independently created a photographic documented archive, or sample book, of choices, which was open to suggestions for new commissions.  We placed two commissions to be collected on our way back from this field study tour.  We also took the opportunity to make a video of the procedures and process technology, step by step.      The neighbourhood with its workshops in such close proximity has generated a common or symbolic development in relation to the kind of visual iconography in the work produced.  The themes of the motifs, being very similar, show on closer inspection differentiation of individual approaches and variations of the same theme, very valuable for the semantic study of this research project.      I have been working on and off for the last fifteen years with one of the master felt-makers of Afyou, who we next visited.  A catalogue has been established of his range of products, together with some old samples.  Also he himself has been collecting some photographs from his own history.  This was the starting point from which to commission a few pieces for the B.M. collection.  The technique applied to his local wool had to be changed for this special occasion.  The final result was to convince us of his willingness to apply new methods to his technique and his capability of creating good quality felts by these methods ... He chose the deer cult image out of a Western drawing book, so the particular image is of a deer from a Walt Disney cartoon!      The city of Konya has been a very important centre for certain sects of the Muslim religion since the eleventh century until the present day. One of the sects established was named Akhi, or member of the brotherhood, and formed one of the first artisan guilds.  Their first chief was the master felt maker, and he was later closely associated with the Sufis through the son of Mvlana Cedflaleddin-I Rumi, who established the sect in Konya.  This historical context, together with the requirement that sufi's headwear must be distinctive, prompted the use of the ancient moulding or shaping capability of felt to exploit the city's craft skills.  It also helped to establish Konya as one of the most important centres not only for felt-makers but also for the attendant skills of its craftsmen in carpet and kilim weaving to a high level of excellence.      These established felt-makers in this city (numbers of whom are diminishing) are still producing high quality felt products, for which there is some demand by the newcomers to the area, such as tourists.  Likewise there is still a demand for apprenticeship in this craft.  The very fine levels of craftsmanship in both product and process technology, for example in the use of natural dyed raw material of the best available quality, good preparation of the wool, and better tuned machinery, are indicative of a high quality culture.      The feltmakers of Konya have kept very detailed photographic records of their traditionally produced pieces to use to attract new commissioned work.  These albums are also valuable historical documents as well as refreshing the memories of the feltmakers as they refer back to their own resource of motifs.      One of the workshops in this centre organises culture tours and accommodates amateur or would-be feltmakers from all over the world in and around its premises.  This particular master feltmaker has been invited to give demonstrations and workshops about felt-making in England, where he made connections resulting in many commissioned works and exports of felted work to many countries such as Canada, the USA and the UK.      The south-east Anatolian city of Urfa used to hold a very important position in feltmaking but the assimilation of nomadic groups of Kurdish and Turkish minorities by the central authorities led to a decline in the tradition.  As the sedentary settlements were enlarged to include these groups, a strategy employed to eliminate the possibility of terrorist action has been in force for the last fifteen years, leading to the disruption or local economic stability.  The older population has, as a result of its feudal history, been independent and anarchic towards any external authority that tried to impose change upon them.  The recent expansion in the population may eventually lead to changed structures, but not before a prolonged and difficult transition period has taken place.      On the periphery of this ancient culture there persisted a semi nomadic tradition where large families still meet for ritual feasts on such occasions as weddings, circumcision ceremonies and some religious holidays, gathering under their tents woven from black goat's hair.  Large felt rugs have usually been used to cover the ground and to sit upon during these meetings.  Many feltmakers are commissioned to produce this type of large, thick and very stiff felted rug.  These are not produced today to replace worn-out ones but made new for the following generation of these very traditionalist people.  Little if any consideration is given to quality, in the Western sense of the word; these products are strictly utilitarian, intended to last long and make these wild, empty interiors a little more dressed up to show the power of the family to which they belong.  The vivid colourways of the motifs are usually primitively stylised and abstractly designed on mainly natural-coloured background.  Some of the influence is distinctly Kurdish.  As at Kula, the feltmakers' quarter is side by side with the tannery and the clipped wool of the pelts, a by-product of the tanning process, is used in the middle of the felted pieces.  Usually felts produced in this way keep the strong smell of sheep for a very long time.      These Arabic and Kurdish nomadic groups used highly stylised and transposed motifs, such as the sun, mixed with the contemporary Turkish crescent and stars which have symbolic meaning, referring to the power of the republic and, reinforced by naming, for example, any star motif 'Commissar Star'. It is difficult to ascertain whether these titles have any element of irony considering the traditional nature of the people who devise them.        Mardin, the last stop in this tour of Anatolia, was suggested to us by one of the old felt-makers of Urfa, who told us that one of the last feltmakers in the region was Armenian or Syrian Orthodox.  However, when we arrived we found that he was dead, but there was another felt-maker, an old Kurdish man of 75, who is the last person to have a workshop here, though sadly no longer in use.  We were taken by the local tailor to the old man's workshop behind the fruit and vegetable market, but his old age, hearing difficulties and lack of the Turkish language made communication very difficult.  He had some left-over felted pieces from a client's large order locally commissioned.  The would-be client, who turned out to be 'on the fiddle', delayed producing any money, therefore the old man did not trust him and kept his pieces.  When he finished the 25-piece collection he wanted to sell out his business and retire.      The commissioned pieces referred to were brightly coloured, bulky, with motifs freely laid out on large background.  The excess dye in the coloured fleece was in a harmonious but random way blended into each other as a consequence of the stem finish process, creating half-toned mid-colours.  The exuberant energy of these special pieces was bright and sunny, they were also very good examples of using colour in this region as it varies from culture to culture.      It is usually the men who make felt in Anatolia, exceptions being found only among the mountaineer nomads called Yuruk.  Their feltmakers are women, as were their ancestors who migrated to Anatolia from Central Asia.",,Not on display,,,,,,,,Purchased from: Selcuk Gurisik,,,,2001,This commissioned collection was made on behalf of the Museum at eight felt-making centres across Turkey during the summer of 2001.,,Middle East,,,,,,

Hammered silver plate with rim defined on the interior with a single engraved line; subsequently detached circular foot ring, now largely missing but indicated by traces of old solder; interior represents the mounted figure of a king brandishing a lion cub in one hand in a manner characteristic of Late Antique hunts. The cub's parents are depicted leaping upwards, one already wounded and the second being slashed with a long straight double-edged pommel-less sword held in the king's right hand. The rider has already discarded his bow but he still carries his decorated tapered box quiver slung from his right thigh; the scabbard is not visible as it would have been slung on the opposite side. Other details are consistent with other Sasanian depictions, such as the decorated bridle, the pair of tasselled balloons rising from the rear of the saddle, and the absence of stirrups. The sword type is also consistent with Sasanian rather than later depictions. The stylised motif at the bottom of the plate was intended to represent hilly terrain. The silver has been analysed by XRF and suggested to have a silver composition of 94.2 – 94.9%, copper content of 4.05 – 4.7%, and 0.5 – 0.7% gold. Neutron activation analysis confirmed a broadly similar composition of 96.4% silver, 3.02% copper and 0.63% gold. These results are consistent with most ancient silver but the minor trace elements distinguishes it from other objects believed to have been made from a so-called ""central Sasanian"" ore source. The decoration was made by engraving and chasing, and extensive areas of the design were spot gilded, including the crown, chest-girdle, belt, parts of the quiver, vertical trouser folds, horse harness, the horse’s hooves and tail, balloon fittings, and the lions’ bodies. Dots on the interior, including one on the back of the rider’s hand, appear to be remnants from the laying out of the design. There is no centering mark on the underside, nor are there traces of an inscription indicating previous ownership, value or weight. 	The rider is popularly interpreted as being a representation of the Sasanian king Bahram (Varahran) V (r. 421-439), who was renowned for his hunting exploits, with a scene similar to this described in the Shah-Nameh. However, the rider's crown is beribboned and crenellated, with a crescent on either side and surmounted by a korymbos. This does not exactly match that of Bahram V, or indeed any other Sasanian ruler, each of whom adopted an individual crown on their accession to the throne and which are carefully depicted on their coin portraits. Although at least some of these rulers are known to have had more than one crown type, it is more likely that this plate is a later attempt to glorify the hunting exploits of Sasanian monarchy rather than being a specific portrait: the successful hunt became a metaphor for royal khwarnah (glory and good fortune), and this extended to the owners of the plate. As such, this object has been regarded as provincial Sasanian production of the 5th, 6th or 7th century. The relatively sketchy manner in which the design was executed supports this interpretation, and it shares close stylistic comparisons with an inscribed plate in the Blumka collection which is palaeographically dated between the 5th and mid-7th centuries, and a second example found at Chilek near Samarkand. All of these have silver compositions which suggest they originated from sources other than that used for so-called “central Sasanian” plates as those contain slightly higher amounts of iridium and are presumed to originate within Iran.
	This plate was acquired by Major-General Alexander Cunningham (1814-1893) of the Indian army and later Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India. It later passed into the collection of Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks (1826-1897), who bequeathed it to the British Museum. It inspired a number of copies which are said to have been made in Rawalpindi and Peshawar: one was acquired by the Hermitage in the 19th century from the Paris branch of the dealer Feuerdent but recognised by Smirnov (1909: no. 55) as ""modern"", a second entered the collection of the Armenian dealer-collector Hagop Kevorkian by 1937, and a third version made of gold was also reported by Smirnov (Harper 2000: 54).","Smirnov 1909 / Vostochnoe Serebro; Sarre F 1922a / Die Kunst des Alten Persien; Pope 1938 / Survey of Persian Art (essay by J.

Copper alloy “master of animals” hollow standard-finial, cast using the lost wax technique. It represents an unarmed Janus figure (owing to its facing in two directions) with a prominent nose, eyes, eyebrows and mouth, grappling a pair of rampant stylised lions who are biting his large ears. The bodies of each are fused into the central tube. The representation of the lions with elongated necks, prominent rears and curly tails is in typical Luristan style, yet the motif of a hero overcoming wild beasts was popular over much of the ancient Near East and lasted for several millennia. The parallel ridges around the tube imitate tightly wrapped cord. 
The literature on these objects is very large as they attracted wide attention among collectors and art historians as soon as they circulated on the art market. They have been variously called “standards”, “Gilgamesh finials”, “idols”, “talismans”, “Stangen-Aufsätze”, “tubes”, “finials” or “standard-finials”, although Godard (1931: pls L-LVII) described them as “idoles funéraires” following his observations of contemporary looting of cemeteries across Luristan during his tour of the region in 1929. Examples acquired via the art market are often mounted on metal tubes but this association is often dubious and it is more likely that at least some were mounted on wooden rods. The fact that the central figure was intended to be seen from both sides supports the idea that they were mounted rather like the whorl on a spindle rather than being the head of a pin thrust through a cloak. They were found in male graves at Tattulban, Gul Khanan Murdah and Chamahzi Mumah, but the findspots do not assist interpretation of function. 
The discoveries of the ancient cemeteries of Luristan followed a crippling civil war and forced settlement of the Lur tribes in villages. Chance finds made during the course of construction attracted the attention of nearby Jewish dealers in rugs and hides and commercial excavation soon followed. Whereas the plain pottery was discarded, plain bronzes melted down as scrap metal and some of the beads recycled as jewellery, other objects were recognised as saleable antiquities and were moved through family carpet trading networks to Europe within a year. Paris was the European centre of trade but “Luristan bronzes” were collected by all the major museums and private collectors and the first canonical “Luristan bronzes” were offered to the British Museum in July 1930. These discoveries finally explained a long-running mystery over the origin of a very small number of identical objects which had been found in the 19th and early 20th centuries but which had hitherto been labelled “Cappadocian” or “Armenian” as they were acquired via dealers from those regions. Amongst these is this object which is the first-known “Luristan bronze”. It was purchased by the British Museum in 1854 from Captain Felix Jones of the Royal Navy and East India Company. Jones had previously served in Mesopotamia, where he carried out several important topographic surveys along the Euphrates and Tigris valleys, and in 1844 travelled with Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Rawlinson through the border areas including the Pusht-i Kuh district of Luristan. It is not clear whether he acquired this object in western Iran or during his time in Iraq.",Moorey P R S 1974b / Ancient Bronzes from Luristan; Curtis 1994b / A fibula of possible Luristan type; Simpson 2008a / Bronzes du Luristan.

Payments for Baglione's work are recorded between September 1610 and August 1612. The unusual medium and level of finish suggest that it was made for presentation to Paul V. An earlier study for the figures of Leo and his murderers is in the Art Museum, Princeton University (1948-620; Smith O'Neil pl. 65).

This drawing was formerly attributed to the seventeenth-century Bolognese painter Giacomo Cavedone (1577-1660). Baglione's authorship was recognised by Julien Stock. It is a preparatory sketch, with significant differences, for a fresco on the ceiling of the Cappella Paolina in S. Maria Maggiore, Rome, one of the most lavishly decorated chapels erected in the city in the first quarter of the seventeenth century (reproduced  in Mâle, 1951, p.25, fig.6, and O'Neil, 1992, II, fig.99). The chapel contains the tombs of Paul V Borghese, who commissioned it, and Clement VIII Aldobrandini, by whom he had been created Cardinal. The frescoes celebrate the virtues of the Virgin, illustrate the devotion to holy images reaffirmed by the Counter-Reformation theologians, and commemorate opponents of heresy; their iconography is discussed in detail by Mâle. Baglione's fresco illustrates God's vengeance on iconoclasts. The gruesome death of the emperor Leo, which was foretold to his mother by the Virgin in a dream, was the result of his persecution of worshippers of holy images.

Chandler watches calmly from the ferry while his companions struggle to encourage their nervous horses to step aboard. In his 'Travels in Asia Minor' (see below) he does not mention this difficulty, remarking only that the ferryman was dark skinned before proceeding to describe the impressive remains of ancient Miletus. He recalled the huge building beyond the ferry: ""The principal relic of … former magnificence is a ruined theatre, which is visible afar off, and was a most capacious edifice, measuring in front four hundred and fifty-seven feet. The external face of this vast fabric is marble ... The seats ranged, as usual, on the slope of a hill, and a few of them remain. The vaults, which supported the extremities of the semi-circle, with the arches or avenues in the two wings, are constructed with such solidity as not easily to be demolished. The entrance of the vault of substruction, on the left side, was filled up with soil; but we examined that next the river; one of our Armenians going before us with a candle in a long paper lantern. The moment we had crept in, innumerable large bats began flitting about us. The stench was hardly tolerable; and the commotion of the air, with the apprehensions of our attendant, threatened us with the loss of our light"".
Miletus - thirty-five kilometres south of Ephesus - was a wealthy port in the first millennium BC with important schools of philosophy and science. The theatre was built in the 4th century BC with a capacity of 5,000. It was enlarged by the Romans to hold 15,000 and used for gladiatorial shows and wild animal fights. By the 4th century AD the silt deposited by the river Maeander had turned what had been open sea to marshland and Miletus lost trade and thus population. It is now some eight kilometres inland. 

L. Stainton, British Landscape Watercolours:1600-1860 (BM, exh. cat., 1985):
In 1764 William Pars, aged twenty-two, was commissioned by the Society of Dilettanti (a group of noblemen and gentlemen founded in 1733 whose aims included a furthering of the appreciation of the Antique)  to accompany Chandler and Revett's expedition to Asia Minor, in order to record the sites they visited: they were to return in 1766. Hitherto, Pars seems to have practised as a portrait painter and to have aspired to history-painting; there is little evidence of any accomplishment as a topographical or landscape artist before this expedition. His Ionian watercolours are therefore even more remarkable achievements. In them Pars rose to the challenge of his first major commission,  developing both  the extreme  precision necessary in an archaeological draughtsman and a sensitive response of the exotic landscape and its inhabitants. After his death in Italy in 1782 (from an illness apparently contracted from standing in the cold water at Tivoli while sketching) his close friend Thomas Jones wrote that Pars had ""an inward bias in favour of Landscape, though brought up to Portrait. . .though in a fit of splean, he would sometimes curse his Fate in being obliged to follow such trifling an Employment; as he called it - it was with the greatest difficulty his Friends could detach him from his favourite Study"".
Richard Chandler's account of the expedition, 'Travels in Asia Minor', 1775 (reprinted in abridged form in 1971, with a commentary on Pars's watercolours by Andrew Wilton) describes the expedition's itinerary, while Pars's watercolours (of which seventeen are in the Department) were engraved both in 'Ionian Antiquities' (vol. i, 1769; vol. ii, 1797), published by the Society of Dilettanti, and as aquatints by Paul Sandby between c.1777 and c.1780. The first drawing, Mm,11.63, shown at the Royal Academy's very first exhibition in 1769, depicts members of the expedition boarding the ferry to cross the River Maeander (the Englishmen have grown moustaches like their Turkish companions); the topographical element - the theatre at Miletus - has been relegated to the middle distance. In Mm,11.73 the central focus of the composition is a tomb of Hellenistic or Roman date, which still stands complete just outside the ancient city of Mylasa; the burial chamber is in the lower storey. Pars's view of the stadium at Laodicea, Mm,11.70, is perhaps the most remarkable of the series both in terms of composition and his sensitivity to the nuances of atmosphere. On the return journey to England, the party stopped briefly in Athens, where Pars made several studies, including a view of the Erectheum, Mm,11.4. Colour notes inscribed in pencil suggest that Pars did in fact work on his watercolours in front of the motif at least to a fairly advanced stage.","Wilton 1971 / Travels in Asia Minor (reprinted with a catalogue of Pars' watercolours by Andrew Wilton); Stainton 1985 / British Landscape Watercolours 1600-1860; Binyon 1898-1907 / Catalogue of drawings by British artists, and artists of foreign origin working in Great Britain",Not on display,"1769, London, Royal Academy, no. 83

Volney's original article in the Moniteur, 21 November 1798 read as follows (copied from www.napoleon1er.org/forum chimeras orient accessed 25 May 2014): Au centre des objets, [Bonaparte] les considère sous de nouvelles faces ; et son esprit prompt à de grands mouvements, forme une combinaison nouvelle et plus grande. Laissons dit-il, à Azeman-Chak et Tipoo-Sultan le soin de chasser les Anglais du Bengale; Azeman le peut seul avec ses cent vingt mille cavaliers.

C'est vers l'Europe qu'il faut ramener le théâtre de la guerre. [...] Je mettrai l'Egypte en état de conservation et de défense; je préparerai une expédition en m'affidant les Arabes, les Druses, les Maronites. Maître de la Syrie, j'y formerai mes garnisons et je protégerai par les montagnes ma marche rapide sur les frontières du désert.[...] J'appellerai les Bédouins, les Turkomans, les Kourdes, les Arméniens, les Persans, à la ruine de leur ennemi commun ; et formant un tourbillon de cavalerie, je franchirai rapidemment les deux cents lieues qui me sépareront du Bosphore, et j'entrerai à Constantinople. Là s'ouvre une carrière nouvelle ; je rentre sur la scène de l'Europe et y forme un contrepoids à tous les pouvoirs. Je puis rétablir ou affermir la république de toute la Grèce. Par l'Albanie et Corfou, je touche l'Italie et à la France. Je puis relever des ses débris la Pologne et former un état qui rétablisse l'ancienne balance dans le Nord. L'Autriche, replacée entre deux ennemis, a de plus vives alarmes et craint l'affranchissement de la Hongrie ; la Prusse reprend son état naturel d'alliance avec la France et le nouvel empire de Byzance. Le Danemark et la Suède, soulagés du poids de la Russie, développent leurs moyens et leurs influences. Moskow, jaloux de Pétersbourg, réclame son indépendance. L'Angleterre, repoussée de l'Archipel, quitte la Méditerranée, et les gouvernements, las enfin de tant de guerres, de combats, d'incendies, de crimes et folies, se trouvent par accablement capables de recevoir la paix. 
Puissé-je le voir, ce jour, le seul glorieux, et tracer au pied du grand obélisque de Constantinople cette inscription de gratitude :
A l'armée française, victorieuse de l'Italie, de l'Afrique, de l'Asie. A Bonaparte, membre de l'Institut national, pacificateur de l'Europe.""",BM Satires / Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum,Not on display,"Exhibited:
